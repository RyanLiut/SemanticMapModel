# A graph algorithm for semantic map models

## Functions

1. To construct a semantic map according to the instance-function matrix.

2. To visualize the map using nodes and weights.

3. To evaluate the map in terms of internal statistics, the requirements of continuity hypothesis, and the differences between the ground truth. 

## Results

1. Our method can get a competitive result according to the evaluation.
2. Our method is far more efficient than human constructions.

## Examples

1. An dialect investigate to “敆”
2. Repetitive adverbs
3. Repetitive adverbs with more functions
